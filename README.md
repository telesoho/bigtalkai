# 入门指南

For a brief overview of TensorFlow programming fundamentals, see the following guide:

TensorFlow编程基本原理的简要概述，参考下列指南：

* [Getting Started with TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started)入门指南

MNIST has become the canonical dataset for trying out a new machine learning toolkit. We offer three guides that each demonstrate a different approach to training an MNIST model on TensorFlow:

MNIST已经成为测试新的机器学习工具的规范化数据集，我们提供三个指南，每个都演示了以不同的方式在TensorFlow上训练MNIST模型。

* [MNIST for ML Beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners)
  , which introduces MNIST through the high-level API.
* [Deep MNIST for Experts](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros)
  , which is more-in depth than "MNIST for ML Beginners," and assumes some familiarity with machine learning concepts.
* [TensorFlow Mechanics 101](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/mechanics)
  , which introduces MNIST through the low-level API.

For developers new to TensorFlow, the high-level API is a good place to start. To learn about the high-level API, read the following guides:

* [tf.contrib.learn Quickstart](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/tflearn)
  , which introduces this API.
* [Building Input Functions with tf.contrib.learn](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/input_fn)
  , which takes you into a somewhat more sophisticated use of this API.
* [Logging and Monitoring Basics with tf.contrib.learn](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/monitors)
  , which explains how to audit the progress of model training.

TensorBoard is a utility to visualize different aspects of machine learning. The following guides explain how to use TensorBoard:

* [TensorBoard: Visualizing Learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard)
  , which gets you started.
* [TensorBoard: Embedding Visualization](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/embedding_viz)
  , which demonstrates how to view and interact with high-dimensional data, such as embeddings.
* [TensorBoard: Graph Visualization](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/graph_viz)
  , which explains how to visualize the computational graph. Graph visualization is typically more useful for programmers using the low-level API.
